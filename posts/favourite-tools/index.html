<h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a class="direct-link" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>I will try to keep an updated list of my favorite tools here.</p>
<p>It will be split as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools that I want to give a massive shout-out for. These are tools that I think are amazing and more people should know about them and use them. I will add to each item a short description and some reasons why I like them so much.</li>
<li>This will be followed by a list of tools I use, grouped by category. These tools are chosen by me as the best in category for the job I use them for. However they are either already very well-known, or just not good enough to deserve a massive shout out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start!</p>
<h2 id="big-shout-out-for-these-tools-%F0%9F%93%A2">Big shout out for these tools 📢 <a class="direct-link" href="#big-shout-out-for-these-tools-%F0%9F%93%A2">#</a></h2>
<p>These are tools that I think are amazing and more people should know about them and use them. The tools are listed in no particular order.</p>
<h3 id="pdf-xchange-editor-(freemium)"><a href="https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor">PDF-Xchange Editor</a> (Freemium) <a class="direct-link" href="#pdf-xchange-editor-(freemium)">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor">PDF-Xchange Editor</a> from <a href="https://www.tracker-software.com/">Tracker Software</a> is hands-down my favorite PDF Editor.</p>
<p>I like it because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is pretty, light-weight, featureful and very easy to use.</li>
<li>It is actively maintained &amp; developed.</li>
<li>Tracker's customer support is something I have not seen anywhere else. The support personal are  knowledgeable, friendly and very responsive. No question in the <a href="https://forum.tracker-software.com/viewforum.php?f=50">support forum</a> is left unanswered, no email is ignored. Just overall amazing.</li>
<li>They have a buy-once licensing scheme instead of a subscription model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="everything-(free%2C-proprietary)"><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/">Everything</a> (Free, Proprietary) <a class="direct-link" href="#everything-(free%2C-proprietary)">#</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/">Everything</a> is an amazing file search tool from <a href="https://www.voidtools.com/">voidtools</a>. Now, I would have thought (and still do think so...) that Everything is a terrible name for a tool (&quot;Hey, have you heard of everything?&quot;, &quot;Heard of what??? 😕&quot;). But apparently it is good enough to come out first in a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Everything">Google search</a> for the word &quot;everything&quot;.</p>
<p>My favorite use for it, is something it wasn't designed for. I</p>
<p>I like it because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very light-weight, extremely fast and very featureful.</li>
<li>It is actively maintained and seems to be of very high quality code.</li>
</ul>
